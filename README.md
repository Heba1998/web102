## What Is a Growth Mindset?

Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts. Churchill

These wise words by Churchill unfold what the growth mindset is all about: seeing opportunities instead of obstacles.

That means seeing failure as a chance to develop your abilities further, instead of rolling into your cocoon and hiding from the world.

As scientific evidence shows, your intelligence, talents, and abilities donâ€™t necessarily stop growing once you reach adulthood. According to psychologist Eric Ericsson, humans go through several stages of development throughout their life. Every stage is defined by the challenge you need to overcome in order to continue to the next stage.

However, as we grow up, it sometimes happens that we change our perspective: we stop believing that we are capable of growth and development, and we build a debilitating and static self-image instead.
